RetroGamelib is a library built for creating NES and GameBoy style games. RGL is written in Python (http://python.org/) and uses PyGame (http://pygame.org/) as a graphical interface. Our aim in creating this library was to give the user as much freedom with PyGame as possible, and provide a simple, easy-to-use set of modules.

## Features ##
  * A display system with window-scaling support.
  * Synched gamepad+keyboard support, and an easy-to-use NES/GameBoy button-styled module.
  * A built-in font module, featuring both NES and GameBoy-styled fonts.
  * Polygon collisions with response, using the Separating Axis Theorem.
  * A camera module.
